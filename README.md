# whadoeat
A mobile platform for meal recipes and recommendations with Flutter
This project is designed to make original recipe suggestions to users and to be a guide in their daily lives like a recipe book. 
Some of the files I could not uploaded were big sized so, only the libraries and images of the application.
The application is written in flutter dart. The database is managed with Firebase, it is cross platform. 
The recommendation algorithm was designed with Python and Sci-Kit Learn. Flask API was used for the API, gunicorn and nginx were used for the server.
